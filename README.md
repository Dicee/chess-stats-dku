# chess-stats-dku

A simple set of scripts to collect chess games from lichess.org and chess.com and make some analysis on opening performance. To go quicker, I'll use some AI to generate the scripts and won't pay too much attention to code quality, I just want to have a tool to analyze my openings and maybe help other people to do the same. This is also the opportunity for me to ramp-up on using [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com/), as I just joined there as an engineer. I also have a pure Python + Jupyter version of this repository called [chess-stats](https://github.com/Dicee/chess-stats).
